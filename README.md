# hackmit-keepup

Content sharing is one of the main ways that we connect with each other nowadays, like sending TikTok, song, and movie links through texts. 
 Currently there is no centralized way to share all types of content among users, which is where we come in. Our app would replace ambiguous content sharing sites like Pinterest (specializes in photos) and more specialized rating platforms like GoodReads and LetterBoxd (focuses on one specific form). It provides a consolidated way for friends to “KeepUp” with each other by allowing them to share their recent interests and content, from Spotify to Netflix to TikTok. We also solve the problem of sending content to only one individual, but rather share it to your close friends simultaneously!
